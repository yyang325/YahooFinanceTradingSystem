We gonna use bower to manager our front-end dependencies, if you haven't got bower on your windows machine, here is what you can do:

And the link is: https://ruleoftech.com/2015/setting-up-bower-and-gulp-in-windows

Install Git

Bower needs Git to work so first install Git if you don’t have it. I chose Git for Windows which gives you BASH emulation used to run Git from the command line, graphical user interface for using Git and Shell integration.

Just click through the installation.

Install Node.js

Bower depends on Node.js and NPM so you need to get Node.js. Just download the installation package from Node.js site and click through it.

Install Bower

After you have Node.js installed we can install Bower with npm. You might need to restart your Windows to get all the path variables setup so Npm can find them.

Open up the Git Bash or Command Prompt and Bower is installed globally by running the following command.

$ npm install -g bower
Once you have Bower installed you then can install packages and dependencies using these commands:

# Using a local or remote package
bower install <package>
 
# Using a specific version of a package
bower install <package>#<version>
 
# Search packages
$ bower search <package>
By default packages will be put in the bower_components directory which can be changed if you prefer. If you want your packages downloaded into js/libs you can achieve this by creating a .bowerrc file

.bowerrc

{
    "directory": "js/libs"
}
You can also create a bower.json file which allows you to define the packages needed along with dependencies and then simply run bower install to download packages. In our example we setup a simple Backbone.js application which uses Bootstrap.

bower.json

{
    "name": "Foobar",
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "dependencies": {
          "jquery": "~2.0.3",
          "underscore": "~1.5.0",
          "bootstrap": "~3.3.2",
          "backbone": "~1.1.2"
    }
}
Our bower.json describes that we want some JavaScript libraries and as we have defined the version with ~ it can have bigger minor versions, e.g. jquery version can be between 2.0.3 < 2.1.0. Read more about semantic versioner for npm.

Now after creating that file inside the app directory you can run the following command:

$ bower install
After that you should see all your JavaScript packages under bower_components folder.
